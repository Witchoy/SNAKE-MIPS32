This Snake game was **partly** made by Jules Goy and Kilian Sakhi for a school project. 
The language used to power the Snake is Assembly Mips 32 and Mars v4.5 is required to execute it.
In order to play the game you'll need to activate the "Bitmap Display" (Settings : 1,1,256,256) and the "Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator" (both are in the Tools tab).
